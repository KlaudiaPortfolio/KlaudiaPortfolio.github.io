It was my first big role, meaning I didn\'t quite grasp what I needed to do; however, the other production designer helped me understand how to make things easier for everyone to divide the workload. I would\'ve done many things differently but overall, I really appreciated being given this opportunity, as it solidified my interests in production design. In my role, I was in charge of making the posters and set building. There was a point where I had to make a prop on set to make sure it worked and looked as realistic as possible.</p>')">

In this role, I was in charge of sourcing some elements for the office scene and sourcing some cables for the spaceship scene. It was mainly helping the director show his vision, as he is also interested in production design; he made the whole ship look really cool. I was there to take care of the little things that were needed.</p>')">

In this role, I had to source clothing to be put around the room to make it messy. Main tasks for this piece were keeping track of continuity as everything was being thrown around, and the shots needed to match up. In addition to production designer, I was also a boom operator, as it was only a short piece, I didn\'t mind doing it; however, it wasn\'t my preferred role, and my passions lie elsewhere. It was a good experience trying something new, and it helped me solidify my interests in production design.</p>')">

We worked with a Super 8 camera, which was a challenge at times because it was hard to position. It was all done handheld. The short film was about a pair of shoes, from being passed down to being forgotten. I enjoyed lighting the scene and helping out with the camera itself. It was a simple idea, but it came out looking beautiful. The acting roles are never my preferred roles, but because it was just shoes and feet, it was an environment I felt less pressure to get everything perfect, as it was a silent short, there were no lines to mess up.</p>')">

In this project, I had to make a clay mountain and steps in the mountain, acting as the goblin. My hands were also used for the plum scene, where I had to hold them in an artistic way. I also acted as the girl in the poem. This project was a lot of fun, and a lot of green screen was used, which gave me a look into how I could work in the green screen room if I ever needed to.</p>')">

In this project, I did as the name suggests I ran around a lot. I helped out in many aspects of the short. Setting up the spaces. Holding and setting up lights. Throwing props across the screen. My favourite aspect of it was making the balloons for the living room to act as a left-behind, forgotten party space. The bedroom was also one of my favourites to set up as it included a lot of art on the walls to really bring the character alive. This was a good project to really show me how each department worked and what each role required and how student films are made in general. It was a big learning experience for me and really made me think about what I\'d like to do in the future.</p>')">

I played a party goer that eventually got lines given on set to put more pressure on the main character. It was a fun set where I met a lot of different exchange students at the time and got to learn about how their programs work where they live. It was a really fun experience.</p>')">

We worked inside the green screen room, making sure we had appropriate clothing so nothing will reflect. Me and some other classmates at the time were acting as mine workers. It was a simple role however gave me insight into how the green screen room works.</p>')">
