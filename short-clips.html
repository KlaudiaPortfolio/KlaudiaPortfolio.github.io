It\'s a very simple back and forth between the character and the plant. I used this to practice my editing skills. The only thing I\'d change is using an actual camera rather than my phone for better quality, since the window light served as the only lighting.</p>')">

I was inspired by water, hence the name as it means water in Polish. I used old clips that I had from another project I worked on. This piece is made to represent memories and nostalgia and how they can be seen. The flow of water is used to show how memories flow by us without us even noticing. Next time, I would\'ve made the laugh a little lighter-sounding, as it sounds quite unsettling, however, I\'m satisfied with the rest of it.</p>')">

We all decided on what shot should be done and have collaborated to film it, however we all edited it in different ways. If we had more time, I would\'ve loved to take a wider variety of shots.</p>')">

This was a plan for a series about a teenage girl finding she\'s connected to Athena and greek mythology in some way, finding out it\'s true secrets and what actually happened but little does she know Athena also is able to go into her body and control her. This was a fun project to plan out even though it never came to life. Ideally, the trailer would\'ve been of higher quality, however because it was a short timeline I didn\'t have much of a choice.</p>')">
