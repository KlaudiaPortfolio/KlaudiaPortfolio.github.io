This piece is made to represent memories and nostalgia and how they can be seen. The flow of water is used to show how memories flow by us without us even noticing. Next time, I would\'ve made the laugh a little lighter-sounding, as it sounds quite unsettling, however, I\'m satisfied with the rest of it.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/VdasXU98rgU')">

I\'m not too interested in the documentary style of filming; however, I put my own twist into making it a fantasy documentary about a gonk complaining about the student moving into his house. I used classic documentary shots to create the look of an actual documentary. This was a project made by myself in my uni house at the time. I enjoyed the comedy and cinematic aspect of this project. I\'m not opposed to doing something similar again, but wouldn\'t choose to do it unless I really felt a pull towards this story again.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/hZTpi9jPbXs')">

I wanted to draw upon strong emotions, which led me to choose disgust, as it proves that art does make a difference, even if it was a short clip. It made my peers and my lecturer feel something and mention it later to me. That\'s what I love about creating, it provides a space for people to feel and experience things even if it might not be happening in front of them.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/eCxgkUTV3wY')">

This was a fun project to plan out even though it never came to life. Ideally, the trailer would\'ve been of higher quality, however on account of the short timeline I didn\'t have much of a choice.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/7M7kxfymtvk')">

I created a world where a girl defeats monsters with her electric guitar. I made a trailer for it that used clips from other films and series. I wish I had worked on it a little more. The overall concept is there in the trailer, but it doesn’t have the specific look that I was looking for, and the editing could have used some more time and care.</p>', 'https://youtube.com/shorts/nItyy7wVozw')">

We learned about the Kuleshov effect: how it works, how it\'s used, and how to apply it. I worked with a classmate to create different shot sequences that would bring out different emotions with the help of editing and sound. All of the shots shown could\'ve easily been edited and sound designed in so many different ways, and that\'s the beauty of film. Not one person can create the same thing twice. There\'s beauty in the way a human mind thinks and designs, and that\'s really what I tried to emphasise with this short exercise.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/64nyBVzk9bo')">

I decided to make a classic comedy silent short that included a clown curse being passed to the next person. It was quick and easy to tell the story. I collaborated with two of my peers to create this short. They helped me with filming, acting and gathering ideas on how the final piece was going to look. This was an enjoyable project to work on, as it was fast but for a short clip like this, I believe the idea was portrayed quite well, and many of my other peers and lecturers also enjoyed it.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/TFRwa7g5q5I')">

I was inspired by creature design and wanted to use that in a way to create a humanoid creature but with edit. I also got inspired by surrealism and videos for art galleries. I found it interesting separating the facial features and bringing them closer together as each piece moves around or even stays still, even though there\'s clear sound. I\'m definitely interested into researching this style more and the history of it.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/xs_l077_1-Q')">

It is an experimental short film about a girl and her dream. I was inspired by the idea of dreams and how they might relate to what a person is missing or wants in their life. In this instance, the thing is \'freedom\'. I explored how freedom could be represented and is seen by people. At the time I researched by asking my peers as well as going online to see symbols of freedom, with one topic appearing quite often, that being birds and fields. I also added a sort of princess as the main character in the dream as it adds nostalgia to the mix which gave the short more depth. I’m happy with how it turned out but there’s definitely certain aspects that would have been easier with other people involved. Ideally I would have had someone behind the camera as I couldn’t zoom in as I was shooting, however, I’m proud of what came out of it.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/WrubKWzUh8A')">

I was inspired by fashion brand adverts and really enjoyed working in that environment. I worked with my friends which made the creative process easier, smoother and helped relieve some of the pressure of developing a short. I also experimented with some different editing techniques, mainly focusing on played around and mimicked how brands edit their fashion advertisements. The main focus was the dresses so I placed them in different lighting to show how they can be seen in different environments. Next time, I would make sure I get some more shot variations, and make use of my improved editing skills, so that the piece can be perfect.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/TtIEcOH8l64')">

It was a montage of short clips and interviews a few days before the end of sixth form. Since I won’t be able to show the video because my whole sixth form year is in there, I\’ll give a little summary of it. I used everyone\'s voices saying their names as some clips of our year played out then it went into interviews and thank yous to the head of year. I ended it off with looping it back to a montage of short clips. This was a last minute project having less than a week to put it together and gather the interviews. It ended up being 3:30 minutes long and it was a nice memory for everyone. It was a learning experience and gave me a look into the documentary style of filming and editing. Time was definitely needed to make it perfect, however I value this experience as I learned so much about filming and collaboration. </p>')">

It wasn\'t required, but I believe the place deserves to be edited and shown over and over. It\'s a beautiful place with different species of plants and animals roaming around. This video is special to me because it shows the connection between not only people and nature but also between ourselves. In this trip, I talked to this lovely gentleman about my course and what I do and learnt a little about him and his family. I asked him if he\'d like to be on camera for a second, and he agreed. The Eden Project brings everyone and everything together, and that\'s why I believe it\'s beautiful. I learned so much about myself and my peers during this trip and I\'ll always keep the memory of it in my heart. The finished project came out just as I envisioned it as I really took my time making sure it\'s perfect and not rushed, as nature doesn\'t rush. This helped me understand the beauty in patience and how the best result is achieved with it.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/pRJ_M-8ri9w')">

It\'s about the hardship within relationships and the power of a first love. I originally planned for it to be a little more artistic; however, there was a lot of pushback when writing the script, saying it was too ambitious and long. The script was longer than it should\'ve been for 3 minutes, so I listened to the feed and kept the most important aspects of the short. I do agree that if it were longer, it would\'ve had more time to show its full potential. There\'s a lot of editing and sound changes I would\'ve done as I had a tough time syncing everything, but I have since then learned what I should\'ve done. It was a good idea, and with more help, it would\'ve been executed the way I envisioned it.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/Bapnrsnp96w')">

The short was about two girls who get stuck in a house party bathroom together. I made sure this time around to choose a really simple idea, to make sure it all goes smoothly. This was my first time directing, and it taught me patience as well as the importance of choosing a good crew. It was a rollercoaster of making sure everything is in line and ready for the shoot. There are a lot of things that I would\'ve improved with the short itself, but also with my directing. The end result didn\'t end up exactly as I wished, but I appreciate the crew for their hard work, and it has taught us all something important.</p>', 'https://youtu.be/KehwOMua5Aw')">
