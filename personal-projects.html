I was inspired by water, hence the name as it means water in Polish. I used old clips that I had from another project I worked on. This piece is made to represent memories and nostalgia and how they can be seen. The flow of water is used to show how memories flow by us without us even noticing. Next time, I would\'ve made the laugh a little lighter-sounding, as it sounds quite unsettling, however, I\'m satisfied with the rest of it.</p>')">

The overall concept is there in the trailer, but it doesn’t have the specific look that I was looking for, and the editing could have used some more time and care.</p>')">

It is an experimental short film about a girl and her dream. I was inspired by the idea of dreams and how they might relate to what a person is missing or wants in their life. In this instance, the thing is \'freedom\'. I explored how freedom could be represented and is seen by people. At the time I researched by asking my peers as well as going online to see symbols of freedom, with one topic appearing quite often, that being birds and fields. I also added a sort of princess as the main character in the dream as it adds nostalgia to the mix which gave the short more depth. I’m happy with how it turned out but there’s definitely certain aspects that would have been easier with other people involved. Ideally I would have had someone behind the camera as I couldn’t zoom in as I was shooting, however, I’m proud of what came out of it.</p>')">

I was inspired by fashion brand adverts and really enjoyed working in that environment. I worked with my friends which made the creative process easier, smoother and helped relieve some of the pressure of developing a short. I also experimented with some different editing techniques, mainly focusing on played around and mimicked how brands edit their fashion advertisements. The main focus was the dresses so I placed them in different lighting to show how they can be seen in different environments. Next time, I would make sure I get some more shot variations, and make use of my improved editing skills, so that the piece can be perfect.</p>')">

It was a montage of short clips and interviews a few days before the end of sixth form. Since I won’t be able to show the video because my whole sixth form year is in there, I\’ll give a little summary of it. I used everyone\'s voices saying their names as some clips of our year played out then it went into interviews and thank yous to the head of year. I ended it off with looping it back to a montage of short clips. This was a last minute project having less than a week to put it together and gather the interviews. It ended up being 3:30 minutes long and it was a nice memory for everyone. It was a learning experience and gave me a look into the documentary style of filming and editing. Time was definitely needed to make it perfect, however I value this experience as I learned so much about filming and collaboration. </p>')">
